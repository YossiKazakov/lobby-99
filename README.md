# Year summary for Lobby 99

Team project with a group of designers from Bezalel and a fellow developer.
This voluntary project was undertaken for the LOBBY 99 association.
Our objective was to develop a personalized, long scrolling mobile landing page tailored to the characteristics of each member.
To accomplish this, we employed Next.js for efficient routing and rendering, integrated Supabase as the backend database for seamless data management and implemented a unique front-end layout using React.js
